I believe I'm the right person to lead this community forward because I have spent the last few months working on a sentiment analysis project alongside professor
bradford and adjunct professor iacovacci, who recommended me to apply for this position. I have been a member of this community for 2 years and have attended
most events. My good friend An, who is stepping down from this role now has told me a lot about the role and responsibilities and I do think I can fulfil them.
I'm also very passionate about technology, I love helping people, I spent 2 semesters working as a teaching assistant for computer science courses and loved it.
