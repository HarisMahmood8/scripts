Storing & then processing:
Processing as we go:


So our process has a lower memory consumption, since we
are not storing everything, but it has
a lot of redundunt file creation since we will have to create
an additional step to check all the files for duplicates.
After all the files are created, we would have to delete
them.

Since they are stored as separate files, it would be a lot
more difficult to analyze the test cases as a whole or
do anything with them.
