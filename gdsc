 I have spent the last few months working on a sentiment analysis project alongside professor bradford and adjunct professor iacovacci, who recommended me to apply for this position.
 I have been a member of this community for 2 years and have attended most events. My good friend An, who is stepping down from this role now has told me a lot about the role and responsibilities
 and I do think I can fulfil them. I'm also very passionate about technology, I love helping people, I spent 2 semesters working as a teaching assistant for computer science courses and loved it.
